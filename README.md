# Home-Price-Prediction

The project aims to use advanced regression techniques to predict the final price of homes. This
has many business applications. For example, people who are interested in flipping homes could use
models created in this project to find undervalued homes, such that they can obtain a bigger profit
margin from flipping it. Another application would be home buyers using the models to determine if the
sellerâ€™s ask price is unfair.
